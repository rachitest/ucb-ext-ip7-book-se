# Demos


## Video solution

The video contains a video recording of the solution, which is based on
completing the main.js file provided you. All required functionality
(search, loading, next/prev page, and displaying the books) is demoed
for you.


## ZIP demo solution

This .zip file contains a "compiled" demo version of this. You can use
it for an interactive reference, as you work on your own version.
However, the "video" version should be the first one you study for
behavior!

DO NOT use any of the code in the compiled demo version -- it is not
meant to be used, or even studied!  The code itself is useless to you
for several reasons: 1) it's compiled, so it's a huge mess and you can't
read it easily, 2) it's solved using a framework, so the solution
approach is useless to you, and 3) it's not 100% identical compared to
the solution in the video, which is the one you should seek first to
emulate (e.g.  note the lack of "Publisher(s)" in the video, slight api
tweak, etc).
